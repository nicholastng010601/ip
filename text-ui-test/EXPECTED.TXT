 Hello! I'm Nichbot
 I am a task planning bot that will help you record your tasks.
 I currently can record 3 types of tasks. tasks to do, tasks with deadlines and events
 Here is how you can record down your events.
 To record tasks to do, simply begin your command with "todo" followed by a space and the task you need to do.
 To record tasks with deadlines, simply begin your command with "deadlines" followed by the task and a / then the due date.
 To record events, simply begin your command with "events" followed by the event, / and start time , then / with the end time
